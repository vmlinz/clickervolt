Advanced click tracking, affiliate link cloaking and campaigns management made easy. ClickerVolt is used for tracking campaigns performance.

== Description ==
All ClickerVolt features are available in the FREE version. Support is only available as a paid option.

[ClickerVolt](https://clickervolt.com/) is a tool used by affiliates who want to know everything about their visitors and their affiliate marketing campaigns performance. It is the perfect link tracking plugin for anyone running paid traffic campaigns, be it solo ads, pay-per-click, native, push, pop, you name it! It is also an amazing tool to track who clicks your affiliate links, in your blog posts, in your Facebook groups, Twitter feeds, Instagram, emails or any other medium.

Whenever a visitor clicks one of your links, you are immediately able to find out:

* His location (country tier, country, region, city, zip code, timezone)
* His language
* His ISP
* His IP address
* His device type, device brand, device name, browser, OS
* Which site he is coming from
* As well as any custom variable you may have added to your link

It also allows you to track your conversions/revenue, either by placing a conversion pixel on your thank you pages, or by giving a custom s2s (server-to-server) postback URL to your affiliate networks.

For those of you running paid traffic, you can also track your cost and ROI.

Not only that, you are also able to route your traffic to different pages based on rules you setup. For example, you could send all Spanish-speaking visitors to a page, all Chinese-speaking ones to another page, and the rest to a fallback page.

You can setup rules based on:

* Your visitor's location (country, region, city)
* Your visitor's language
* Your visitor's ISP
* Your visitor's IP address
* His browser's user agent
* Device type, device brand, device name
* Browser or OS
* or based on the current date, day of the week, hour of the day
* based on specific words in the URL, or values of specific query parameters
* or based on which site referred the visitor
* and more...

You can split-test URLs (with weighted rotators) to find the best performing ones, you can cloak your links, you can track the click-through-rate of your offer links from your landing pages, you can track complex flows and non-linear affiliate and sales funnels, you can trigger your retargeting pixels whenever someone clicks one of your links and so much more!

To analyze your stats, ClickerVolt gives you access to:

* A feature-rich drilldown reporting system, allowing you to dissect and analyze your traffic in a tree table
* A live clicks-log to see all traffic coming in real time
* Integration with Google's AI to detect bots, fraud and suspicious traffic 

ClickerVolt is a dream-come-true tracker for affiliates. It is a premium link tracking software which we decided to release for free.

== Similar Affiliate Software ==

ClickerVolt is similar to popular tracking software like CPV Lab PRO, ClickMagick, Voluum (Codewise's Voluum Tracking), Bemob, RedTrack, ClickMeter, FunnelFlux, Kintura, Adsbridge or Binom.

All these other software come with recurring subscriptions and expensive pricing. We initially wanted to sell ClickerVolt too (and we actually did sell it to a small base of affiliates) - but we then decided to go with another model:

Make the product 100% free, with all the features one would expect from a premium paid tracking solution, and sell platinum addons for advanced use cases.

At this time, only two add-ons are available:

1: Support - which is given by experienced and successful affiliates, who speak the language and understand the needs of performance marketers.
2: Voltify Takeover - a way to completely take over remote pages and change any data on the fly ([examples here](https://doc.clickervolt.com/clickervolt-add-ons/voltify-takeover-redirect-mode)).

Example of add-ons we plan to release:

* Traffic source integrations - allowing you to create paid traffic campaigns from your ClickerVolt dashboard, pause placements or change bids automatically based on your own optimization rules.
* Auto replacement of blog links with "ghost" tracking links (invisible affiliate links - very important for Amazon affiliates as Amazon forbid the use of redirect links)

Paid users are also prioritized when it comes to feature requests.

== Affiliate Networks ==

ClickerVolt helps you promote offers from popular CPA or traditional affiliate networks, like MaxBounty, Peerfly, A4D, C2M, CPAWay, Clickbank etc. All these networks allow you to append a unique tracking ID to your affiliate links. ClickerVolt automates this by the use of its clickid [cid] token. You can then give your ClickerVolt postback URL to these networks to receive conversion notifications in realtime.

== Traffic Sources ==

ClickerVolt works with all major traffic sources: 

* Facebook Ads
* Google Ads (previously known as Google Adwords)
* Bing Ads
* ZeroPark
* AdMaven
* MegaPush
* PopAds
* Content.Ad
* MGID
* Taboola
* Outbrain
* etc...

ClickerVolt works with the new Google Ads parallel tracking out of the box. It is actually one of the only trackers working with Google Ads parallel tracking.

== AIDA Metrics: Our Unique Selling Point ==

FREE is never enough. In addition to all the features above, we have a feature that no other tracker has. 

A feature mainly for affiliates paying for their traffic, but not only. A feature that will save you both time and money.

Before telling you what this feature is, let me start by telling you what the problem is - let's illustrate it with the following example:

You are running a PPC campaign and you are bidding on 3 different keywords:

* keyword 1
* keyword 2
* keyword 3

Your are advertising a product making you $30 per sale.

You do not know yet if any of these 3 keywords will be profitable or not, so you need to test each of them. 

After spending $40 (and not one single sale yet), you look at your PPC dashboard, and you see this:

* keyword 1 - spent $15
* keyword 2 - spent $10
* keyword 3 - spent $15

At this point, any of these keywords still remains a good candidate. You don't know, maybe after spending five more dollars on keyword 3, you will get your first sale. That would make a spend of $20 for keyword 3 and a revenue of $30 - netting you $10. Likewise, you could still make a sale from keywords 1 and 2 before spending $30 on each of them, making them all profitable.

But the point is: this testing phase, that we usually call the optimization phase, is extremely expensive.

If you had 100 keywords (and it's easy to reach), you would have to spend at least $30 (your offer payout) on each single one of them before deciding wether to cut it or to keep it. 100 * $30 = $3,000 for the optimization phase.

There must be a better way... 

And yes, there is! It's called AIDA tracking.

ClickerVolt is the only affiliate tracking software integrating AIDA in all its reports, making the optimization phase much faster, and way less expensive.

[Check the AIDA case study on our website](https://clickervolt.com/case-study/)

== Performance ==

You should care about speed. Speed matters.

Amazon, Google and others tell you that faster page loads directly correlate to increased ROI.

This is why you should never use a slow link tracking software.

ClickerVolt is faster than the next best tracker, and we have benchmarks to prove it.

For high traffic campaigns, we recommend using a VPS or dedicated server.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I choose ClickerVolt instead of another tracker? =

ClickerVolt is already great to use, but we are working hard to make it even better and the go-to-tracker platform for affiliates. We believe we will reach our goal very soon for a few reasons: 

1. It's very fast! The user panel is a pleasure to use as there is no page-load at all to access all ClickerVolt features. Plus, as you can see in [our benchmarks](https://clickervolt.com/benchmarks/), redirects take less than 1ms of click-processing time, which is way faster than other trackers (speed matters for conversions!)

2. It's easy to install and update - it's a WordPress plugin so no technical knowledge required

3. It's the only tracker integrating AIDA in its reports, which makes optimizing your campaigns much faster than with other trackers.

4. It's one of the only trackers allowing you to build unlimited depth funnels (with multiple landers and offers in the same funnel)

5. It's built by successful affiliates for affiliates. We know what affiliates need - and we are open to your features request.

= Do you have an affiliate program? =

Yes, we do! Install the plugin and click on the "affiliation" menu to start promoting ClickerVolt. You can earn monthly/yearly/lifetime commissions.
